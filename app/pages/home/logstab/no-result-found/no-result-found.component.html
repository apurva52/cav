<p id="msg1">Unfortunately I could not find any results matching your search. I tried really hard. I looked all over the place and frankly, I just couldn't find anything good. Help me, help you. Here are some ideas:</p>
<h2>Expand your time range</h2>
<p id="msg2" >I see you are looking at an index with a date field. It is possible your query does not match anything in the current time range, or that there is no data at all in the currently selected time range.  
Try with different time range.For future reference you can open the time picker by clicking on the button in the top right corner of your screen.</p>
<h2>Refine your query</h2>
<p id="msg2">The search bar at the top uses NetForest DataBase support for NFDBCoreQuery String syntax. Let's say we're searching web server logs that have been parsed into a few fields.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<p id="msg2">Find requests that contain the number 200, in any field:</p>
<input type="text" value="200" disabled />
<p id="msg2">Or we can search in a specific field. Find 200 in the status field:</p>
<input type="text" value="value:200" disabled />
<p id="msg2">Find all status codes between 400-499:</p>
<input type="text" value="status:[400 TO 499]" disabled />
<p id="msg2">Find status codes 400-499 with the extension php:</p>
<input type="text" value="status:[400 TO 499] AND extension:PHP" disabled />
<p id="msg2">Or HTML</p>
<input type="text" value="status:[400 TO 499] AND (extension:php OR extension:html)" disabled />
